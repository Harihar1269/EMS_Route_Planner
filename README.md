# EMS_Route_Planner
The EMS Route Planner is a smart routing tool that helps emergency medical services find the quickest paths to hospitals by factoring in real-time traffic, patient priority, and hospital capacity. Built with A* search and Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) techniques, it optimizes routing to reduce EMS response times in critical situations.
